## Key terms

**Ciphertext -** The result of encrypting a plaintext, encrypted data

**Cipher -** A method of encrypting or decrypting data. Modern ciphers are cryptographic, but there are many non cryptographic ciphers like Caesar.

**Plaintext -** Data before encryption, often text but not always. Could be a photograph or other file

**Encryption -** Transforming data into ciphertext, using a cipher.

**Encoding -** NOT a form of encryption, just a form of data representation like base64. Immediately reversible.

**Key -** Some information that is needed to correctly decrypt the ciphertext and obtain the plaintext.

**Passphrase -** Separate to the key, a passphrase is similar to a password and used to protect a key.

**Asymmetric encryption -** Uses different keys to encrypt and decrypt.

**Symmetric encryption -** Uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt

**Brute force -** Attacking cryptography by trying every different password or every different key

**Cryptanalysis -** Attacking cryptography by finding a weakness in the underlying maths

**Alice and Bob -** Used to represent 2 people who generally want to communicate. They’re named Alice and Bob because this gives them the initials A and B.

### I agree not to complain too much about how theory heavy this room is.

### Are SSH keys protected with a passphrase or a password?

{% hint style="success" %}
passphrase

## Why is Encryption important?

Cryptography is used to protect confidentiality, ensure integrity, ensure authenticity. You use cryptography every day most likely, and you’re almost certainly reading this now over an encrypted connection.

###  What does SSH stand for?
