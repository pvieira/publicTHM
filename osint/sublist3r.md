# Sublist3r

## Task 1 Intro

You can also use this site if you don't want to run Sublist3r: [https://dnsdumpster.com/](https://dnsdumpster.com/)

You can find Sublist3r [here](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r)! We'll install this in the next task.

{% hint style="success" %}
no answer needed
{% endhint %}

### Next, let's clone the Sublist3r repository into opt: git clone [https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r.git](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r.git)

{% hint style="success" %}
no answer needed
{% endhint %}

### Now let's move into the Sublist3r directory we've just created: cd /opt/Sublist3r

{% hint style="success" %}
no answer needed
{% endhint %}

### Finally, let's install the requirements for running Sublist3r: pip3 install -r requirements.txt

## Task 3 Switchboard

### What switch can we use to set our target domain to perform recon on?

{% hint style="success" %}
-d
{% endhint %}

### How about setting which engines we'll use for searching? \(i.e. google, bing, etc\)

{% hint style="success" %}
-e
{% endhint %}

### Saving our output is important both so we don't have to run recon again but also so we can return to our returns and review them at a later time. What switch do we use to define an output file?

{% hint style="success" %}
-o
{% endhint %}

### Sublist3r can sometimes take some time to run but we can speed through up the use of threads. Which switch allows us to set the number of threads?

{% hint style="success" %}
-t
{% endhint %}

### Last but not least, we can also bruteforce the domains for our target. This isn't always the most useful, however, it can sometimes find a key domain that we might have missed. What switch allows us to enable brute forcing?

{% hint style="success" %}
-b
{% endhint %}
