## Resources

Start radare2: `r2 -d ./file1`

Analyze the program: `aa`  It analyses all symbols and entry points in the executable

For general help, we can run: `?` or if we wish to understand more about a specific feature, we could provide `a?`

To find a list of the functions run: `afl`

Letâ€™s examine the assembly code at main by running the command `pdf @main` Where `pdf` means print disassembly function.



* leaq source, destination: this instruction sets destination to the address denoted by the expression in source addq source, destination: destination = destination + source subq source, destination: destination = destination - source imulq source, destination: destination = destination \* source salq source, destination: destination = destination &lt;&lt; source where &lt;&lt; is the left bit shifting operator sarq source, destination: destination = destination &gt;&gt; source where &gt;&gt; is the right bit shifting operator xorq source, destination: destination = destination XOR source andq source, destination: destination = destination & source orq source, destination: destination = destination \| source

What is the value of **local\_ch** when its corresponding movl instruction is called \(first if multiple\)?

{% hint style="success" %}

{% endhint %}

What is the value of **eax** when the imull instruction is called?

{% hint style="success" %}
