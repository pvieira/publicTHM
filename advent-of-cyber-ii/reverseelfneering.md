## Resources

Start radare2: `r2 -d ./file1`

Analyze the program: `aa`  It analyses all symbols and entry points in the executable

For general help, we can run: `?` or if we wish to understand more about a specific feature, we could provide `a?`

To find a list of the functions run: `afl`

Letâ€™s examine the assembly code at main by running the command `pdf @main` Where `pdf` means print disassembly function.

| Initial Data Type |  Suffix | Size \(bytes\) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Byte | b | 1 |
| Word | w | 2 |
| Double Word | l | 4 |
| Quad | q | 8 |
| Single Precision | s | 4 |
| Double Precision | l | 8 |

When dealing with memory manipulation using registers, there are other cases to be considered:

* \(Rb, Ri\) = MemoryLocation\[Rb + Ri\]
* D\(Rb, Ri\) = MemoryLocation\[Rb + Ri + D\]
* \(Rb, Ri, S\) = MemoryLocation\(Rb + S \* Ri\]
* D\(Rb, Ri, S\) = MemoryLocation\[Rb + S \* Ri + D\]

Instructions:

* **leaq** source, destination: this instruction sets destination to the address denoted by the expression in source
* **addq** source, destination: destination = destination + source 
* **subq** source, destination: destination = destination - source 
* **imulq** source, destination: destination = destination \* source 
* **salq** source, destination: destination = destination &lt;&lt; source where &lt;&lt; is the left bit shifting operator
* **sarq** source, destination: destination = destination &gt;&gt; source where &gt;&gt; is the right bit shifting operator
* **xorq** source, destination: destination = destination XOR source andq source, destination: destination = destination & source
* **orq** source, destination: destination = destination \| source

A breakpoint specifies where the program should stop executing. `db @memory-address` and the parameter must be the memory address.

Run the program using `dc`

To view the contents of the local\_ch variable, we use the following instruction `px @memory-address`

To go step by step use `ds`

#### Workflow...

The general formula for working through something like this is:

* set appropriate breakpoints
* use ds to move through instructions and check the values of register and memory
* if you make a mistake, you can always reload the program using the ood command
