## Resources

Start radare2: `r2 -d ./file1`

Analyze the program: `aa`  It analyses all symbols and entry points in the executable

For general help, we can run: `?` or if we wish to understand more about a specific feature, we could provide `a?`

To find a list of the functions run: `afl`

Letâ€™s examine the assembly code at main by running the command `pdf @main` Where `pdf` means print disassembly function.
