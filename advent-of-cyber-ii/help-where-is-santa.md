## Challenge

What is the port number for the web server?

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28112%29.png)

{% hint style="success" %}
8000
{% endhint %}

Without using enumerations tools such as Dirbuster, what is the directory for the API?  \(without the API key\)

{% hint style="success" %}
/api/
{% endhint %}

Where is Santa right now?

{% hint style="success" %}

{% endhint %}

Find out the correct API key. Remember, this is an odd number between 0-100. After too many attempts, Santa's Sled will block you. 

To unblock yourself, simply terminate and re-deploy the target instance \(10.10.127.91\) 

{% hint style="success" %}
57
{% endhint %}
