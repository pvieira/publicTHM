## Challenge

Open "pcap1.pcap" in Wireshark. What is the IP address that initiates an ICMP/ping?

{% hint style="success" %}

{% endhint %}

If we only wanted to see HTTP GET requests in our "pcap1.pcap" file, what filter would we use?

{% hint style="success" %}

{% endhint %}

Now apply this filter to "pcap1.pcap" in Wireshark, what is the name of the article that the IP address "10.10.67.199" visited?

{% hint style="success" %}

{% endhint %}

Let's begin analysing "pcap2.pcap". Look at the captured FTP traffic; what password was leaked during the login process?

There's a lot of irrelevant data here - Using a filter here would be useful!

{% hint style="success" %}

{% endhint %}

Continuing with our analysis of "pcap2.pcap", what is the name of the protocol that is encrypted?

{% hint style="success" %}

{% endhint %}

Analyse "pcap3.pcap" and recover Christmas!

What is on Elf McSkidy's wishlist that will be used to replace Elf McEager?

{% hint style="success" %}
