## Resources

`pip install X`

`pip3 install requests beautifulsoup4`

```python
# Import the libraries we downloaded earlier
# if you try importing without installing them, this step will fail
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests 

# replace testurl.com with the url you want to use.
# requests.get downloads the webpage and stores it as a variable
html = requests.get('testurl.com') 

# this parses the webpage into something that beautifulsoup can read over
soup = BeautifulSoup(html, "lxml")
# lxml is just the parser for reading the html 

# this is the line that grabs all the links # stores all the links in the links variable
links = soup.find_all('a href') 
for link in links:      
    # prints each link    
    print(link)
```
