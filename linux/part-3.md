Linux allows you to change the location of the current directory through the use of the cd command. The syntax of the cd command is this, `cd <directory>`.

The syntax for a symbolic link is the exact same, but it uses the -s flag, so to create a symbolic link, you would run `ln -s <file> <destination>`.
