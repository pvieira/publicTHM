{% endhint %}

### Deploy the machine attached to this task!

{% hint style="success" %}
No answer needed
{% endhint %}

## Task 2 SSH - Intro

SSH is the act of remotely accessing a machine. SSH allows you to run commands interactively on the remote machine. This is done through the use of a program on the target machine, which allows the ssh client to interface with the target host.

### Read the above

{% hint style="success" %}
No answer needed
{% endhint %}

## Task 3 Putty and SSH

The syntax on how to use this command is `ssh <user>@<host>`.

### SSH into the server

* password: pinguftw

```text
ssh shiba2@
```

{% hint style="success" %}
No answer needed
{% endhint %}

## Task 4 \[Section 4: Linux Operators\]: "&&"

&& means as you might expect "and". Meaning && allows you to execute a second command after the first one has executed successfully.

### Read the above

{% hint style="success" %}
No answer needed
{% endhint %}

## Task 5 \[Section 4: Linux Operators\]: "&"

& is a background operator, meaning say you run a command that takes 10 seconds to run, normally you wouldn't be able to run commands during that period; however, with & that command will still execute and you'll be able to run other commands.

### Read the above

{% hint style="success" %}
No answer needed
{% endhint %}

## Task 6 \[Section 4: Linux Operators\]: "$"

The $ is an unusually special operator, as it is used to denote environment variables.

`touch $USER`

Environment variables can also be set pretty easily, just running `export <varname>=<value>` will set that as an environment variable

### How would you set nootnoot equal to 1111 

{% hint style="success" %}
export nootnoot=1111
{% endhint %}

### What is the value of the home environment variable

```text
echo $HOME
```

{% hint style="success" %}
/home/shiba2
{% endhint %}

## Task 7 \[Section 4: Linux Operators\]: "\|"

The pipe is unique because while operators like &gt;&gt; allow you to store the output of a command, the \| operator allows you to take the output of a command and use it as input for a second command.

### Read the above

{% hint style="success" %}
No answer needed
{% endhint %}

## Task 8 \[Section 4: Linux Operators\] - ";"

The ; operator works a lot like &&, however it does not require the first command to execute successfully.

### Read the above

{% hint style="success" %}
No answer needed
{% endhint %}

## Task 9 \[Section 4: Linux Operators\]: "&gt;"

&gt; is the operator for output redirection.

### How would you output twenty to a file called test

{% hint style="success" %}
echo twenty &gt; test
{% endhint %}

## Task 10 \[Section 4: Linux Operators\]: "&gt;&gt;"

&gt;&gt; does mainly the same thing as &gt;, with one key difference. &gt;&gt; appends the output of a command to a file, instead of erasing it.

### Read the above

{% hint style="success" %}
No answer needed
{% endhint %}

## Task 11 Binary - shiba2

What is shiba3's password

```text
echo $USER
export test1234=shiba2
./shiba2 
```
